My intention with this project is to be able to perceive the mental of top players and also make the tools to come up with solutions for problems they
create as well as a description of what the tools are meant to be used for, what they describe, and a process for implementing them.

The end goal is simple: eventually be able to beat top players and be able to stay ahead of them once i get ahead of them. Anyone else should also
be able to use the data provided here to do the same thing. It should be clear, understandable, and reproducible regardless of where someone starts.

Why do this? I need to do a few things that accomplishing *this* would satisfy. The biggest one is 'breaking' a system with a system I have made. I also
wish to complete an actual project for once, and winning in this game is important for me in my life right now (money). That said, this seems like an okay
usage of my time given my circumstances in life. Once this is done, I can finally relax on my 'grind' to push my lowest performance far above what I need
to not lose to random people while I rely on this income.

## **How will this get accomplished?**

The same way any other problem gets solved: description of patterns and a clear path for recreating consequences.
If I assume that I either know nothing or know the wrong things, using tools which correctly describe events and teach me to recreate the situations
I need to in order to win, then the tools provided here *should* course correct me (or anyone else) over time through repeated use. But first I need to
define what a tool actually is and what it's for. So... let's start with that.

> A tool is a bounded system that, when applied to a situation in its domain, extracts information or structure useful for explanation or action.

**Each tool transforms specific inputs (such as in-game states, opponent behaviors, or internal triggers) into structured outputs like evaluations,**
**action suggestions, or mental state updates. The goal is to make unpredictable or complex situations explainable and navigable under pressure.**
**Tools are designed to:**

*Operate within a clearly defined domain*
*Produce useful representations, even with very little time*
*Leave room for ambiguity (“blank space”) to support creativity*
*Be composable — they interact with each other to form adaptive systems*
*Fail visibly and non-catastrophically, enabling correction*

**all able to be applied anywhere and still produce usable information**

If this definition of a tool is good enough... then we need tools to start with for gathering information from the massive set of unknown unknowns
in front of us now:

1. **Displace the Frame**
Typically useful for redirecting someone who thinks they know a good set of tools for gathering information. This means give up what you think is
"right" and take what I'm saying here with some level of seriousness. Even if just to consider the validity of it, being receptive to information
is the only way to learn. If you're here to learn... do it right. Listen, then decide afterwards.
Besides this you can also move around assumptions, boundaries and premises (within contextual allowances), or incorporate new ones from other domains
or new research.

2. **Invert the Concept**
Take an idea and try to invert it. This isn't always useful, but it does show sometimes what the tool itself doesn't tell you when you use it.
If that ends up being useful, then we may have a new tool to use.

3. **Chunk → Deconstruct → Rebuild**
Take apart an "absolute truth" that we believe and see if it can be broken into components. Those components are more useful to us as components than
tangled up in a higher order concept.

4. **Look for Conceptual Negative Space**
Find where your tools don't or can't be used. For example, the concept of space doesn't explain how people *use* space, nor when it's being used for
something. That requires a higher order concept.

5. **Apply Ideas in New Contexts**
Try out ideas in spots that might not be intuitive at first, or at all. Oftentimes this produces useful information in almost every context either through
knowing the limits of the idea *or* you may find patterns you wouldn't have otherwise. Overall this is something that should be done a lot.

*These should be used with the understanding that while you learn, there will always be unknowns. The goal of using this set of tools is to reduce that.*
*Even after I define everything, unknowns will still exist. Some unknowns we will know exist (ideally on purpose), some will be the same set we're looking*
*at right now. The same process should be used to reduce it further. Once I'm sufficiently 'ahead' I will stop following this loop.*
*Every tool that I create needs to be created either from using these tools or from ones I make through the usage of these tools.*

*These tools should work regardless of the environment you apply them in. Once we apply them to smash, we should get specialized and contextually useful*
*tools that will work specifically for fighting games as a whole, since many top players play more than just smash it's necessary to encompass the*
*insight that is derived from those games as well as Smash.*

This talks a lot about the space concepts and ideas/tools cover. One could make the argument that the path we should follow is to create tools which cover
every single possibility, but even if it were possible to do so it is extremely inefficient time and effort-wise to do so. I think a better strategy would
be to set up tools in a way that has a lot of 'blank space'. In other words, leave the tool abstract enough to adapt to the situations you apply it to. The
more (meaningful) blank space there is, the better you can adapt it to any arbitrary situation.

**I have made the assumption that using intuition (the internal understanding one has of an arbitrary situation) is necessary and better than having**
**a defined solution for everything. This is because in smash, there isn't enough time to plot out a solution for every case. Sure, you could learn to over**
**time and that does happen naturally with a lot of players and the meta-game in general. But top players tend to stay on top for a reason... let's keep**
**everything adaptable instead of waiting for things to change so we can learn from someone else. Sound good? Sounds good for my purposes.**

## **Logging**

Logging is... difficult. The idea is that github should handle version control for me, but I will make an effort to jot down general ideas I have into
a separate file as well as another file for keeping track of ideas I have thrown out or added along with why for each. The point of logging is to not only
remember what I was thinking throughout the process for future use (because I will forget in several months time) but also for memorization. Do it right.
I should also outline a process for testing ideas and criteria for determining whether or not they are useful before removing them from the ideas.md file.
I currently do not have an outlined process for this and have been going off of feeling for the longest time. I should address that for the sake of making
sure anyone else can also follow my reasoning and use it themselves if they determine that my process is better than their own. I could also receive feedback
from others through making it tangible and reproducible like this.
