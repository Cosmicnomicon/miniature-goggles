## List of ideas to work with and paths to go down. Requires a description so I don't get lost or forget why I came up with it in the first place.

**Have a process for proving the usefulness of an idea or solution to a problem.**
The scientific method is good for this. I doubt I'll need to find another answer, but until I formally decide
that this is what I'll use I'm keeping this here.

**Make sure to check that the problem you're solving actually exists within this new frame.**
Some of your intuitions about this game are correct and have been tested/solved countless times. You still need
to determine whether or not the solution actually fits in your new frame. Maybe it could be solved in a more robust way
using a different set of tools. TLDR just check the conceptual space first, either in theory or 'practice'.

**Try setting boundaries for data that bend when awareness of said boundaries is present, or just absorb awareness instead**
Entropy and isolation generally lead to stagnation over time. The internet also tends to prove this, however some people manage to improve
and get smarter over time despite this. Some use communities, but what about people in isolated regions that manage to improve without access
to the generational knowledge that others have? It seems that there are patterns that could be found here which could be used to achieve growth in isolation.

**Question the purpose of everything. Including the points you use to reduce the initial set of unknown unknowns.**
The scientific method, or anything i derive to force trajectory needs to be made sure to do its job. Question if trajectory is the right 'tool' for
the job. Maybe there's better ones. Question the assumption that you need a tool in the first place. Maybe you'll get some interesting information.
It's more than just worth a shot, it's necessary to bake recursion into the loop or else stagnation is inevitable.
