## List of ideas to work with and paths to go down. Requires a description so I don't get lost or forget why I came up with it in the first place.

**Have a process for proving the usefulness of an idea or solution to a problem.**
The scientific method is good for this. I doubt I'll need to find another answer, but until I formally decide
that this is what I'll use I'm keeping this here.

**Make sure to check that the problem you're solving actually exists within this new frame.**
Some of your intuitions about this game are correct and have been tested/solved countless times. You still need
to determine whether or not the solution actually fits in your new frame. Maybe it could be solved in a more robust way
using a different set of tools. TLDR just check the conceptual space first, either in theory or 'practice'.
