## List of ideas to work with and paths to go down. Requires a description so I don't get lost or forget why I came up with it in the first place.

**Have a process for proving the usefulness of an idea or solution to a problem.**
The scientific method is good for this. I doubt I'll need to find another answer, but until I formally decide
that this is what I'll use I'm keeping this here.////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
**Scientific Method needs to be fixed. It breaks in emergent systems (including psychology)**
The way our new system needs to work is as such:
> It must be able to generate insight
> It must be able to score stability of insight, from both within and outside the system.

> *Alternatively to the previous two, it needs to be able to absorb entropy/signal and convert it into clarity if clarity did not previously exist.*

> It must be applicable to any arbitrary system
> It must enforce low chaos (high stability) solutions
> It must reduce uncertainty over time, stagnate at worst, but never increase uncertainty.
> It must fix itself by the previously mentioned rules if it is ever broken.

# The current toolkit and its flowchart is as follows:

*Mathematics & Set Theory* **Used for checking domains and for proof**
*Equation for testing stability of tools/outcomes* **Used to make sure knowledge found is useful**
*Equation for bending to the Goodhart's Law pattern* **Ensures growth is maintainable forever, never warping from optimization gaming**

**Make sure to check that the problem you're solving actually exists within this new frame.**
Some of your intuitions about this game are correct and have been tested/solved countless times. You still need
to determine whether or not the solution actually fits in your new frame. Maybe it could be solved in a more robust way
using a different set of tools. TLDR just check the conceptual space first, either in theory or 'practice'.

**Try setting boundaries for data collection that bend when awareness of said boundaries is present, or just absorb awareness instead**
Entropy and isolation generally lead to stagnation over time. The internet also tends to prove this, however some people manage to improve
and get smarter over time despite this. Some use communities, but what about people in isolated regions that manage to improve without access
to the generational knowledge that others have? It seems that there are patterns that could be found here which could be used to achieve growth in isolation.
//////////////////////
This is effectively the local minima problem. Find a way to make escape from local minima the default and you solve most of what's mentioned here.

**Question the purpose of everything. Including the points you use to reduce the initial set of unknown unknowns.**
The scientific method, or anything i derive to force trajectory needs to be made sure to do its job. Question if trajectory is the right 'tool' for
the job. Maybe there's better ones. Question the assumption that you need a tool in the first place. Maybe you'll get some interesting information.
It's more than just worth a shot, it's necessary to bake recursion into the loop or else stagnation is inevitable.

**Have tools to gather information when all other tools break.**
This might be the one thing that is necessary in order to make 'infinite adaptation' necessary. Without this, improvement may halt forever.

**Tools for gathering information are effectively the actual measure of 'intelligence'/'knowledge'**
We started with the infinite set of unknown unknowns. Tools and boundaries effectively filter out noise to produce predictions.
Therefore tools and boundaries = intelligence/knowledge

**Make tools which find pattern structure, not just the existence of a pattern.**
The location of meaningful abstract patterns in data matters just as much as the pattern itself. If you don't have ways to find them, teaching others
and yourself becomes much more reliant on luck/entropy.

**Define what a pattern is.**
This matters because it is the crux of my design philosophy.///////////////////////////////////////
**Define how to track down the patterns that actually matter in the system.**
This matters because this is how the scientific method actually gets outclassed. Otherwise your new system breaks to systems problems too.
You could optionally ignore this step sometimes for the sake of exploration but the understanding is that progress is made when consolidation
and simplification happens without losing nuance.////////////////////////////
**Patterns that matter are just parts of the system and patterns are emergent consequences derived from parts interacting.**
Find how to find parts of an arbitrary system, then let data collection start. Stops random data found from becoming meaningless.

**Learning new things often requires shifting your intent away from previous goals**
Doing the same thing repeatedly doesn't often yield new information *unless* the goal is to see if something breaks.
Or if you know something *will* break, then checking where still requires shifting intent.

**Look for ways to add dimensions to knowledge, not just refinement of data/understanding**
Dimensions also need to have some way of being found... nobody knows they exist until they are found after all. Maybe they exist at the
intersection of blank spaces between existing dimensions or systems?

**Understanding and exploitation are not the same.**
Exploitation appears to be when a pattern/system becomes an input to another system.
////////////////////
**Recognize that this framework for thinking and solution-searching is the exact same as any other system: Input to Output.**
This system harvests knowledge and information, the system I plan to use this for should make me a top player in smash (or another fg). The domains
may be different but the process for getting there is the same, so the same rules should apply regardless of domain.
