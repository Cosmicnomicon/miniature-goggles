## Log of changes to my philosophy/toolset and a description of why the change was made

# 10/5/25 xx:xx:xx
Made readme.md and marked current tools.md as placeholder
**Why?** This is the beginning of the project. Had to start somewhere, and tools.md has no real tie to my goals nor defined generation process.

# 10/5/25 18:51:09
Modified the logging section in readme as well as a new line at the bottom of starting toolset to tie into tools.md
**Why?** Logging left a lot to be desired in terms of function and process. tools.md required a tie in for a sense of direction and origination.

# 10/5/25 19:51:53
Modified a line in readme.md.
**Why?** "description of events" was too narrow, "description of patterns" is more generalizable and applicable.
