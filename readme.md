My intention with this project is to be able to perceieve the mental of top players and also make the tools to come up with solutions for problems they
create as well as a description of what the tools are meant to be used for, what they describe, and a process for implementing them.

The end goal is simple: eventually be able to beat top players and be able to stay ahead of them once i get ahead of them. Anyone else should also
be able to use the data provided here to do the same thing. It should be clear, understandable, and reproducible regardless of where someone starts.

How will this get accomplished? The same way any other problem gets solved: description of events and a clear path for recreating consequences.
If I assume that I either know nothing or know the wrong things, using tools which correctly describe events and teach me to recreate the situations
I need to in order to win, then the tools provided here *should* course correct me (or anyone else) over time through repeated use. So... let's start
with nothing but a few tools for gathering information anywhere:

1. **Displace the Frame**
Typically useful for redirecting someone who thinks they know a good set of tools for gathering information. This means give up what you think is
"right" and take what I'm saying here with some level of seriousness. Even if just to consider the validity of it, being receptive to information
is the only way to learn. If you're here to learn... do it right. Listen, then decide afterwards.

2. **Invert the Concept**
Take an idea and try to invert it. This isn't always useful, but it does show sometimes what the tool itself doesn't tell you when you use it.
If that ends up being useful, then we may have a new tool to use.

3. **Chunk → Deconstruct → Rebuild**
Take apart an "absolute truth" that we believe and see if it can be broken into components. Those components are more useful to us as components than
tangled up in a higher order concept.

4. **Look for Conceptual Negative Space**
Find where your tools don't cover. For example, the concept of space doesn't explain how people *use* space, nor when it's being used for something.
That requires a higher order concept.

5. **Apply Ideas in New Contexts**
Try out ideas in spots that might not be intuitive at first, or at all. Oftentimes this produces useful information in almost every context either through
knowing the limits of the idea *or* you may find patterns you wouldn't have otherwise. Overall this is something that should be done a lot.

This talks a lot about the space concepts and ideas/tools cover. One could make the argument that the idea should be to create tools which cover every
single possibility, but even if it were possible to do so it is extremely inefficient time and effort-wise to do so. I think a better strategy would be
to set up tools in a way that has a lot of 'blank space'. In other words, leave the tool abstract enough to adapt to the situations you apply it to. The
more blank space there is, the better you can adapt it to any arbitrary situation.

**I have made the assumption that using intuition (the internal understanding one has of an arbitrary situation) is necessary and better than having**
**a defined solution for everything. This is because in smash, there isn't enough time to plot out a solution for every case. Sure, you could learn to over**
**time and that does happen naturally with a lot of players and the meta-game in general. But top players tend to stay on top for a reason... let's keep**
**everything adaptable instead of waiting for things to change so we can learn from someone else. Sound good? Sounds good for my purposes.**
