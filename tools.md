This file will hold all the tools and emergent tools that I should use to play smash (or any other fighting game)

Base tools:

Game mechanics (Teching, jumping, blocking, ect)
Character kits (pretty rigid. requires creativity and context to be useful)
Space (like the space you can move around in)
Time (the time actions take)
Empathy (your capacity to perceive/understand your opponent's mind/options)

Emergent tools:
Tempo (Empathy + Time: knowing when your opponent takes their turn / when it is your turn)
Movement (Mechanics + Kits + Space + Time: How your character can interact with and control space over time)
