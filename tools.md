This file will hold all the tools and emergent tools that I should use to play/understand smash (or any other fighting game)
These should be used to extract data from each game and also for theorycrafting counterplay to an arbitrary situation.

Base tools:

Game mechanics (Teching, jumping, blocking, ect)
Character kits (pretty rigid. requires creativity and context to be useful)
Space (like the space you can move around in)
Time (the time actions take)
Empathy (your capacity to perceive/understand your opponent's mind/options, gotta break this up into components bc im making a lot of assumptions)

Emergent tools:
Tempo (Empathy + Time: knowing when your opponent takes their turn / when it is your turn)
Awareness (Empathy + Mechanics + Kits + Time + Tempo: The set of things you are thinking about at any given time, and when they're ready for them)
Pressure (Awareness + ???: A perceived threat. Typically forces people to change their decisions or encourages short-sighted mashing)
Movement (Mechanics + Kits + Space + Time: How your character can interact with and control space over time)
Zoning/Positioning (Mechanics + Kits + Space + Time + Empathy: Where to cover/be with x options based on y context)
